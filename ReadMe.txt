On the IFTTT site when you create an Applet create two with one for sunny and another for dark. 
Make sure the value of the ifttt variable is equal to 1 for a sunny notification and 0 for a dark
notification in the "If" section of the applet.

The "Then" section can be your choice of notification.

If you're wondering why there is a 2 set for ifttt in the code, it is used to prevent a false or duplicate notification
sent to you email or choice in the "Then" section of the Applet.
